## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in vLLM Manager, please report it by emailing [your-email@example.com]. Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files to version control
2. **API Keys**: Use environment variables for all sensitive credentials
3. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
4. **Database**: Use strong passwords and restrict database access

### Docker Security

1. **Non-root User**: The application runs as a non-root user in containers
2. **Security Options**: Use `no-new-privileges` and other security options
3. **Network Isolation**: Use custom Docker networks for service isolation
4. **Image Updates**: Regularly update base images and dependencies

### Application Security

1. **Rate Limiting**: Configured to prevent abuse
2. **Security Headers**: Helmet.js provides comprehensive security headers
3. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
4. **CORS**: Properly configured for production environments

### Monitoring and Logging

1. **Security Logging**: Suspicious activities are logged
2. **Log Rotation**: Logs are rotated to prevent disk space issues
3. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for unusual activities
4. **Backups**: Regular backups of configuration and data

### Dependencies

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
2. **Security Audits**: Run `npm audit` regularly
3. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use tools like Snyk or Trivy
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only include necessary packages

## Security Features

- **Helmet.js**: Comprehensive security headers
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DoS attacks
- **CORS**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing configuration
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all inputs
- **Security Logging**: Monitoring and logging of security events
- **Container Security**: Non-root user and security options
- **Environment Separation**: Clear separation of development and production
